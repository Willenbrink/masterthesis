Concurrent programming brings many pitfalls, such as data races, deadlocks and nondeterminism. Previous attempts at preventing these were either incomplete or involved new languages or additional annotations of code, preventing reuse of existing libraries. In this thesis, we present a new approach to integrating safe concurrency into an existing mainstream programming language, Scala. Our language uses the Async Finish model, a variant of the Fork Join model, that is inherently free of deadlocks and deterministic. We build on the work of LaCasa to ensure data race freedom without requiring annotations. We also provide a formalization of the operational semantics for this language and show progress as well as isolation of asynchronous tasks.
